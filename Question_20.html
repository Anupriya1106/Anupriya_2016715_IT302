            I'm <span id="aj">Anupriya Jain,</span><br>
            a designer, developer, and entrepreneur.

            <div id="p1">
                I’ve always loved spending way too much time on the computer, and spent my teens tinkering with
                Photoshop
                and building crappy websites. <br> <br>

                But after getting a computer science degree, I realized writing compilers wasn’t for me and decided to
                switch majors completely and learn Mandarin instead.<br><br>

                Yet as it turns out, my path would lead back to computers: after moving to China in 2006, I ended up
                quitting my language studies and getting a job in Beijing as a web designer.<br><br>

            <div id="p2">
                After coming back to France in 2007, I became a freelance UI designer, working with companies such as
                Hipmunk, Intercom, and Le Monde.<br><br>

                A few years later, I decided what I really wanted was to create my own products, and set out to re-learn
                web
                programming. <br><br>

                After moving to Japan in 2012 for my wife’s studies, I now live in Kyoto and work on running developer
                surveys.

                An open-source full-stack app framework based on React, GraphQL, Meteor, and MongoDB. A.k.a. the “Rails

                <div class="vulcan"> Discover Meteor</div>
                I learned the Meteor JavaScript framework to build Telescope, and decided to reinvest the knowledge I
                had
                just acquired to co-author a book together with Tom Coleman.

                I got tired of all this talk of “JavaScript fatigue”, so I created a survey to get more data about
